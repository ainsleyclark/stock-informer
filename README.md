# ðŸ“ˆ Stock Informer

A small and simple DOM detection changer for when you're in desperate need of a new Nvidia graphics card or anything
else that tickles your pickle.

## Overview

- âœ… Monitor multiple URLs to detect DOM changes.
- âœ… Use a valid crontab selector to run monitoring jobs.
- âœ… Integrates with SMTP email and Slack.
- âœ… Easy use with Docker or running on bare metal.
- âœ… Comprehensive HTTP client that follows redirects.
- âœ… Extremely lightweight with few dependencies.

## Why?


## Installation

Informer can either be run in Docker or using the prebuilt binaries in the releases section.

pages:
  - url: https://test.com # URL to monitor
    selector: .class-selector # DOM selector

## Docker

## Roadmap

- Add `App Debug` to the configuration to hide or show the log debug messages.
- Add more notifiers, [github.com/nikoksr/notify](https://github.com/nikoksr/notify) has been used as a package and
	there are an abundance of notification methods that can be used.
- Call cron monitoring recursively to eradicate waiting for new change.
- Validation on configuration struct.
