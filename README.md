# ðŸ“ˆ Stock Informer

A small and simple DOM detection changer for when you're in desperate need of a new Nvidia graphics card or anything
else that tickles your pickle.

## Overview

- âœ… A humble selection of errors codes that touches most bases.
- âœ… User friendly error messages for returning via an API for example.
- âœ… Operation support `(Struct.Method)` naming convention.
- âœ… Retrieve call stacks as preformatted or as a string slice.
- âœ… Generate HTTP response codes from all error types.
- âœ… Extremely lightweight with no external dependencies.

## Why?

Errors are as important in your domain and application as the entities such as a User or Database. They should be
treated as individual types. Not only do they give a clear meaning to the users of the application if something goes
wrong, they can save hours of debugging time when used effectively.

Coupled with consistent and effective use of a logging package, we are able to tell if something goes wrong, where it
went wrong, how it went wrong and.
