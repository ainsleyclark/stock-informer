# ðŸ“ˆ Stock Informer

A small and simple DOM detection changer for when you're in desperate need of a new Nvidia graphics card or anything
else that tickles your pickle.

## Overview

- âœ… Monitor multiple URLs to detect DOM changes.
- âœ… Use a valid crontab selector to run monitoring jobs.
- âœ… Integrates with SMTP email and Slack.
- âœ… Easy use with Docker or running on bare metal.
- âœ… Comprehensive HTTP client that follows redirects.
- âœ… Extremely lightweight with few dependencies.

## Why?

```yaml
pages:
  - url: https://test.com # URL to monitor
    selector: .class-selector # DOM selector
    schedule: "* * * * *" # Run every minute
notify:
  email:
    address: smtp.gmail.com
    user: hello@hello.com
    password: password
  slack:
    token: token
    channel_id: id
```

## Installation

Informer can either be run in Docker or using the prebuilt binaries in the releases section, information on both methods
are shown below.

#### Download the Binary

Head over to the [releases](https://github.com/ainsleyclark/stock-informer/releases/) page and download the relevant
release to your operating system.

```bash
$ wget "https://github.com/ainsleyclark/stock-informer/releases/download/v0.0.1/informer_0.0.1_darwin_amd64.tar.gz"
> â€˜informer_0.0.1_darwin_amd64.tar.gzâ€™ saved
```

#### Unzip

```bash
$ tar -xf informer_0.0.1_darwin_amd64.tar.gz && cd informer
```

#### Configuration

### Run

```bash
$ ./informer
> [INFORMER] 2022-12-14 08:14:05 | LOG | [INFO] | [msg] Loading Configuration
> [INFORMER] 2022-12-14 08:14:05 | LOG | [INFO] | [msg] Booting Informer
```

### Docker

Docker images are located at
the [packages](https://github.com/ainsleyclark/stock-informer/pkgs/container/stock-informer) page. Be sure to use the
latest version number when pulling the image.

#### Pull the Docker Image

Head over to the [packages](https://github.com/ainsleyclark/stock-informer/pkgs/container/stock-informer) page and pull
the latest image version to your local machine.

```bash
$ docker pull ghcr.io/ainsleyclark/stock-informer:0.0.1
```

#### Run the Image

Running the image requires two required arguments/flags.

- The path to the configuration file stored on the local machine, with the arg `v`.
- The `-path` argument for the binary which should correlate to the path passed in. This will allow you to attach your
	configuration file from your local machine to the docker image.

```bash
$ docker run -it --rm -v /path/to/config/config.yml:/mnt/config.yml ghcr.io/ainsleyclark/stock-informer:0.0.1 -path=/mnt/config.yml
> [INFORMER] 2022-12-14 08:14:05 | LOG | [INFO] | [msg] Loading Configuration
> [INFORMER] 2022-12-14 08:14:05 | LOG | [INFO] | [msg] Booting Informer
```

## Configuration

```yaml
pages:
  - url: https://test.com # URL to monitor
    selector: .class-selector # DOM selector
    schedule: "* * * * *" # Run every minute
notify:
  email:
    address: smtp.gmail.com
    user: hello@hello.com

### Pages

### Notifiers

**Email**:

**Slack**:

## Docker

## Roadmap

- Add `App Debug` to the configuration to hide or show the log debug messages.
- Add more notifiers, [github.com/nikoksr/notify](https://github.com/nikoksr/notify) has been used as a package and
	there are an abundance of notification methods that can be used.
- Call cron monitoring recursively to eradicate waiting for new change.
- Validation on configuration struct.
